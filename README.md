## üåê Packet Tracer Project

This project demonstrates my ability to design, configure, and analyze network environments using Cisco Packet Tracer. Below is a breakdown of the steps involved:

### 1. **Project Objective**

The goal was to create a secure and efficient network infrastructure for a hypothetical organization. This involved designing and simulating VLANs, routing, and security policies.

### 2. **Steps Taken**

- **Network Design**:
  - Created a logical topology incorporating routers, switches, and end devices.
  - Configured VLANs to segment traffic for different departments.
- **Configuration**:
  - Assigned IP addresses and subnet masks.
  - Set up static and dynamic routing protocols (e.g., OSPF).
  - Configured ACLs to enforce security policies.
  - Added a honeypot to distract potential hackers and prevent unauthorized access to the internal network.
- **Testing**:
  - Verified connectivity using `ping` and `traceroute` commands.
  - Simulated traffic to test ACL rules and troubleshoot issues.

### 3. **Challenges and Solutions**

- **Challenge**: Overlapping subnets.
  - **Solution**: Adjusted subnet mask to avoid conflicts.
- **Challenge**: Incorrect ACL rules.
  - **Solution**: Debugged rules using simulation tools in Packet Tracer.

### 4. **Output**

## üìù Request for Proposal (RFP)

The RFP was crafted to outline the requirements for deploying a secure network infrastructure. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key components:

### 1. **Project Scope**

The RFP requested a design for a scalable and secure network solution for a medium-sized enterprise, focusing on:

- High availability.
- Secure communication.
- Minimal downtime during deployment.

### 2. **Requirements**

- **Hardware**: Specify routers, switches, and firewalls.
- **Software**: Recommended use of Cisco IOS and monitoring tools.
- **Security**:
  - Implement VLANs.
  - Use ACLs for segmentation and access control.
  - Enable encryption for sensitive data.

### 3. **Proposal Submission**

- Submission included a detailed network design with diagrams.
- A timeline and cost estimate for implementation.

### 4. **Outcome**

The RFP successfully demonstrated my ability to align technical solutions with organizational needs and budget constraints.

### 5. **Additional Details**
