## üåê Packet Tracer Project

This project demonstrates my ability to design, configure, and analyze network environments using Cisco Packet Tracer. Below is a breakdown of the steps involved:

### 1. **Project Objective**
The goal was to create a secure and efficient network infrastructure for a hypothetical organization. This involved designing and simulating VLANs, routing, and security policies.

### 2. **Steps Taken**
- **Network Design**: Created a logical topology incorporating routers, switches, and end devices; configured VLANs to segment traffic.
- **Configuration**: Assigned IP addresses, set up OSPF routing, configured ACLs, and added a honeypot for security.
- **Testing**: Verified connectivity and simulated traffic to test security rules.

### 3. **Challenges and Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Overlapping subnets. **Solution**: Adjusted subnet masks.
- **Challenge**: Incorrect ACL rules. **Solution**: Debugged using simulation tools.

### 4. **Output**
[Packet Tracer File](https://studentsecpi-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/jonhol1944_students_ecpi_edu/Documents/Microsoft%20Teams%20Chat%20Files/CAPSTONE%20V1.24.pkt?csf=1&web=1&e=zHX8xi)

## üïµÔ∏è Honeypot Project

This project showcases my ability to deploy and manage honeypots to capture and analyze malicious activity, enhancing network security through threat intelligence.

### 1. **Project Objective**
Deploy a honeypot system to attract attackers, log their interactions, and study their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

### 2. **Implementation**
- **Tools Used**: Deployed **T-Pot**, a multi-honeypot platform combining Dionaea, Cowrie, and other sensors.
- **Setup**:
  - Installed T-Pot on a virtual machine (e.g., VirtualBox or AWS EC2).
  - Configured network settings to expose the honeypot to the internet while isolating it from critical systems.
  - Monitored logs via the T-Pot web interface.
- **Execution**: Ran the honeypot for a set period (e.g., 48 hours) to collect attack data.

### 3. **Findings**
- Captured attempts including SSH brute force attacks and malware uploads.
- Analyzed data to identify common attack vectors and IP origins.

### 4. **Documentation and Output**
4. Documentation and Output
 -  Configuration File: T-Pot Configuration

## üéÆ Python Game Projects

To showcase my programming skills, I've developed several Python games using Pygame. These projects highlight my ability to write structured, interactive code and apply problem-solving skills in a fun context. Below are some examples:

### 1. **Multi-Ball Pong**
- **Description**: A twist on the classic Pong game with multiple balls in play simultaneously. Players control a paddle with W/S keys to deflect balls against an AI opponent.
- **Features**:
  - Multiple balls with independent movement.
  - Score tracking for both player and AI.
  - Simple AI that tracks the first ball.
- **Code**: https://github.com/jonathanholl/jonathanholl.github.io/blob/main/multi_ball_pong.py
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Object-oriented programming, collision detection, game loop management.
